<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I've been curious about writing an HTML editor with preview and a property pane for a while, and after writing the article in Tables and Divs, it seemed like a natural progression to put that article to use doing something real, so here we are.</p>
<p>The "talking points" of this article are:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Creating an editor with both horizontal and vertical layout of the editor, preview, and properties sections.</li>
<li>Updating the preview as changes are made in the editor.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
And to make life interesting, this entire article is written using this very HTML editor!
</p>

dynamic HTML

CSS - styles (container and specific attributes), selectors

Both for writing articles and playground for designing a layout

Many todo things:

Autocompletion
Colorization
Ability to use third party libraries
